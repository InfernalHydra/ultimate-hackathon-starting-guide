# Cloud (Google Cloud, AWS, Azure)


## What is Cloud?
Cloud services are a way for us to obtain compute, storage, machine learning, and other functionality by offloading the work onto computers somewhere else, usually at some sort of large server farm. It basically means you can pay a little bit of money to get a small computer or database, which you can use for a specific task. The three big cloud providers are:

* [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/)
* [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/)

All three of these providers have their own consoles, documentation, and services, but they still allow you to do the same thing: buy a computer short-term that resides somewhere far away from you. The biggest types of services that cloud offers are compute and storage. Compute means the ability to buy a computer to perform a specific task, and storage means the ability to buy a database where you can store a large amount of information in a secure manner. All three providers also have services for many other functions such as game development, machine learning, robotics, blockchain, you name it.

## Which provider should I use?
There are many factors to consider when deciding on a cloud provider, but since they all do virtually the same thing, it's just a matter of sticking with one and travelling down its learning curve. If you have credits for a specific provider, which is the case in many hackathons, consider using that one so you don't have to worry about costs. AWS also has a [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc) for all first-time users that lasts for a whole year, and [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and [Google](https://cloud.google.com/free/) have similar options as well. I myself am partial to AWS, but I recommend doing some exploration and picking the cloud provider that sounds the best to you! Once you choose one, a whole realm of possibilities will be opened to you.

## Documentation
Whenever you have a question about the cloud, the most important place to check for an answer is the documentation. The documentation for the three major providers is linked here:

* [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/)
* [Azure Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=featured)
* [GCP Docs](https://cloud.google.com/docs)
