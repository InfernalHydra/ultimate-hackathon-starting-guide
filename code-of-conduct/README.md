# MLH Code of Conduct
The MLH Code of Conduct is the overarching framework that governs hackathon behaviour. While a majority of the rules in the document follow common sense guidelines on how to behave in public, I'd recommend that every hackathon attendee read this at least once. The penalty for breaking these rules ranges from being kicked out of that hackathon to being banned for life from all MLH sponsored hackathons. No one wants that. 

As of May 17, 2020, the official MLH Code of Conduct can be found [here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf).
