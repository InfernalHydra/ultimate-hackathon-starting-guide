# ultimate-hackathon-starting-guide

## What is this?
The *Ultimate Hackathon Starting Guide* is an all-purpose, one-stop guide to hackathons. Whether you are a first time hacker or an experienced professional, we believe that this guide can help you build the best project possible!

## How do I navigate around?
In the various folders, you will find tips and resources for a variety of topics. In our experience, these are the most useful technologies at a hackathon. Click on the folder you are interested in, and start hacking!

## Who made this?
This resource was made by [Freetail Hackers](http://freetailhackers.com/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](utexas.edu). We are a multidisciplinary student organization organizes HackTX annually. :heart:

## What was the inspiration for this guide?
Our entire team is currently quarantining at home. With this abundance of free time, we decided to create a tool that would be useful for hackathons attendees around the world.
