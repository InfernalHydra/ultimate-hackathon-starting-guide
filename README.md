# Ultimate Hackathon Starting Guide

## What is this?
The *Ultimate Hackathon Starting Guide* is an all-purpose, one-stop guide to hackathons. Whether you are a first time hacker or an experienced professional, we believe that this guide can help you build the best project possible!

## How do I navigate around?
In the various folders, you will find tips and resources for a variety of topics. In our experience, these are the most useful technologies at a hackathon. Click on the folder you are interested in and start hacking!

If you are an absolute beginner, welcome to your first hackathon! We'd recommend checking out the [terminal](https://github.com/kdesai2018/ultimate-hackathon-starting-guide/blob/master/getting-started-terminal/README.md) guide first, and then moving on to the [Github starter guide](https://github.com/kdesai2018/ultimate-hackathon-starting-guide/blob/master/getting-started-github/README.md).

## Who made this?
This resource was made by [Freetail Hackers](http://freetailhackers.com/) at the [University of Texas at Austin](utexas.edu). We are a multidisciplinary student organization organizes HackTX annually. :heart:

## What was the inspiration for this guide?
Our entire team is currently quarantining at home. With this abundance of free time, we decided to create a tool that would be useful for hackathons attendees and organizers around the world.
