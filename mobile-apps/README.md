# Mobile Development (iOS, Android, Cross-Platform)
## First things first...should you make a mobile app or stick with a website?
A mobile platform is a great space to develop your ideas for, but it’s usually not the place to start. Creating a website is commonly the first step for getting an idea up and running because its much simpler, for a variety of reasons.
1. You may need minimal setup to start developing a website. Especially if you’re creating a static site with only a frontend, the languages you’ll probably be using (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) are already understood by whichever browser you’re using, and any other tools you might need are quick to setup. Mobile development on the other hand might involve downloading a whole new IDE.
2. Testing is faster for a website. It’s as simple as refreshing the page in your browser. Testing on mobile simulators and physical devices can take a while to start up, and because you may end up having to restart your app each time you make a code change, this can feel slow after a while.
3. Some parts of mobile development are difficult to get around without the right resources; for example, if you want to make an iOS app, you will need a computer running macOS. Web development tools you might need generally run on all major platforms, thus making collaboration easier as well.

That being said though, there are several times where you might be designing a product that is intended for a mobile device. Here are a few reasons why you should create a mobile app. 
1. If it’s important to notify your users of events even when they are not actively using your product. Mobile apps can send push notifications to display information in real time. Websites can do this too, but for users on the go, it’s more likely they’ll be able to check their phones instead of their laptops.
2. If all your content does not require an internet connection. Mobile apps are able to retrieve new content when an internet connection is present, but they may still be able to show some other content without it. On the other hand, you’ll always need to be online to access any part of a website. 
3. If user and world interaction is important. Sharing information with contacts or taking and uploading photos to a social media account are usually much quicker to do on a phone than on a computer.
4. If you need to access specific features. You may need to access the camera, photo library, flashlight, current location, accelerometer, microphone, or something else. There are a great selection of mobile development APIs for working with specific devices on your phone.

Ultimately, it’s your call. We generally won't judge you based on the platform you use, so if you're just interested in learning how to develop a mobile app, that's enough reason to justify making one!
